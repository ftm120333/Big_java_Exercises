/*
    Delegation: This is midway between inheritance and composition
         because you place a member object in the class youâ€™re building (like composition),
         but at the same time you expose all the methods from the member object in your new class
         (like inheritance)

         Exercise 11: (3) Modify Detergent.java so that it uses delegation.
